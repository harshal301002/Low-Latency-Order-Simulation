This repository contains a simplified Python-based simulator for
low-latency order execution. It includes:

- An order book for storing limit orders
- A matching engine for matching new orders against existing ones
- A simulation loop to feed market data, handle order entry, cancellations,
  and trades
- Basic logging and testing framework
